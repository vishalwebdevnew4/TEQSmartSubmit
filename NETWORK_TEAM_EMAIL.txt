Subject: TEQSmartSubmit Server Setup - System Dependencies Installation Required

Dear Network Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to request assistance with completing the system setup for the TEQSmartSubmit project on our server.

SERVER DETAILS:
- Hostname: teqsmartsubmit.xcelanceweb.com
- IP Address: 192.168.0.78
- SSH Access: teqsmartsftpuser@teqsmartsubmit.xcelanceweb.com (Port: 3129)
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Python 3.10.12 is CONFIRMED installed and working on the remote server
   Location: /usr/bin/python3
   Verified: pip3 is available and functional
✅ All required Python packages have been installed:
   - Playwright (browser automation) v1.56.0
   - Chromium browser (downloaded ~280MB)
   - SpeechRecognition, pydub, ffmpeg-python
   - pandas, reportlab, redis (automation libraries)

❌ SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED:
Playwright requires system-level libraries to run browsers. The installation requires sudo/root access, which we don't currently have with the provided SSH credentials.

REQUIRED ACTION:
Please run ONE of the following commands on the server with sudo/root access:

Option 1 (Recommended):
    sudo python3 -m playwright install-deps chromium

Option 2 (Direct package installation):
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libasound2 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libatspi2.0-0 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libdrm2 libgbm1 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libnss3 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxkbcommon0 libxrandr2 libxshmfence1 libxss1 libxtst6

ESTIMATED TIME: Less than 5 minutes

ALTERNATIVE:
If you prefer, we can complete the installation ourselves if the teqsmartsftpuser account can be granted temporary sudo access for package installation only.

VERIFICATION:
After installation, you can verify with:
    python3 -m playwright --version
    python3 -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('OK')"

NETWORK REQUIREMENTS:
No additional firewall rules are needed. The application runs locally and only requires:
- Outbound HTTPS for CAPTCHA solving APIs (optional)
- Port 3000 for Next.js application (if running on server)
- Local PostgreSQL connection (port 5432)
- Local Redis connection (port 6379, optional)

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information. I've attached detailed documentation files in the project directory for reference.

Thank you for your assistance!
